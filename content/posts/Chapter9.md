# Chapter 9: How to Choose the Right Hero

1 And when thou dost play Overwatch, and the time cometh to select thy hero, think carefully.

2 For to choose the right hero is to maximize thy team's chances of success, and to minimize thy team's weaknesses.

3 And though thou mayst have thy personal preferences, thy choices doth not only affect thee, but also thy teammates.

4 So do not be selfish, but instead consider the needs of thy team, and choose a hero that doth complement thy teammates, and counter thy opponents.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to make the right choice, and to play thy hero to the best of thy abilities. Amen.
