# Chapter 5: How to Avoid Blaming Thy Teammates

1 And when thou dost feel frustrated with thy teammates, and the desire to blame them doth rise within thee, pause and consider.

2 For to blame thy teammates is to reject the gift of unity, that the Lord thy God hath given thee.

3 And though thou mayst not understand it at the time, thy teammates doth serve a purpose, and doth bring strength and support into thy team.

4 So do not be quick to judge, but instead offer guidance and encouragement.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to foster teamwork and cooperation, and to overcome adversity together. Amen.
