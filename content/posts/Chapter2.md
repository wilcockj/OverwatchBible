# Chapter 2: Why to Keep Playing

1 And when thou dost feel frustrated with Overwatch, and the desire to uninstall it doth rise within thee, pause and consider.

2 For to uninstall the game is to reject a gift, given unto thee by the Lord thy God.

3 And though thou mayst not understand it at the time, the game doth serve a purpose, and doth bring joy and challenge into thy life.

4 So do not be hasty, and do not throw away that which thou dost not yet fully appreciate.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to find the value in Overwatch, and to enjoy it to the fullest. Amen.
