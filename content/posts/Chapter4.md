# Chapter 4: The Dangers of Pride

1 And when thou dost feel proud, and the game doth seem too easy, humble thyself.

2 For pride is a sin, that doth blind thee to thy own weaknesses, and doth alienate thee from thy teammates.

3 And though thou mayst think thou art better than thou art, the Lord thy God doth see the truth, and doth not judge thee by thy victories alone.

4 So do not boast, but give credit to those who deserve it, and seek to improve thyself.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to see thyself as thou truly art, and to grow in humility. Amen.
