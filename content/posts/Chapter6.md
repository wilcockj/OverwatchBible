# Chapter 6: How to Find Fellowship

1 And when thou dost feel lonely, and the game doth seem too solitary, seek fellowship.

2 For the Lord thy God doth not intend for thee to play Overwatch in isolation, but to share the experience with others.

3 And though thou mayst not have many friends who play the game, there is always a community of players, who can welcome thee and support thee.

4 So do not be afraid to reach out, and to join a team or a guild.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to find fellowship in Overwatch, and to make new friends. Amen.
