# Chapter 8: How to Be a Good Sport

1 And when thou dost play Overwatch, and the outcome of the game doth not go thy way, remain gracious.

2 For to be a good sport is to show respect for thy opponents, and to abide by the rules of the game.

3 And though thou mayst be tempted to curse or complain, such behavior doth not reflect well on thee, nor doth it honor the Lord thy God.

4 So do not be rude or unsportsmanlike, but instead be humble and gracious in defeat, and humble and gracious in victory.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to be a good sport, and to enjoy the game in a spirit of fair play and camaraderie. Amen.
