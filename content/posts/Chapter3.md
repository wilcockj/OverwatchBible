# Chapter 3: How to Overcome Adversity

1 And when thou dost feel discouraged, and the game doth seem too difficult, take heart.

2 For the Lord thy God doth not give thee challenges that thou art not able to overcome.

3 And though thou mayst not see it at the time, every defeat doth teach thee something, and doth make thee stronger.

4 So do not give up, but persist and learn from thy mistakes.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will guide thee through the tough times, and help thee to excel. Amen.
