# Chapter 11: How to Learn from Failure

1 And when thou dost play Overwatch, and the game doth not go thy way, do not despair.

2 For to learn from failure is to grow and improve, and to become a better player.

3 And though thou mayst feel discouraged or frustrated, such feelings doth not change the outcome of the game, but only hinder thy progress.

4 So do not give up, but instead analyze thy mistakes, and seek ways to avoid them in the future.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to learn from thy failures, and to turn them into opportunities for growth. Amen.
