# Chapter 10: How to Communicate with Thy Teammates

1 And when thou dost play Overwatch, and the need to communicate with thy teammates doth arise, do so wisely.

2 For to communicate effectively is to ensure that thy team doth operate as a cohesive unit, and doth achieve its objectives.

3 And though thou mayst be tempted to speak without thinking, or to shout without reason, such behavior doth not foster cooperation, but rather discord and confusion.

4 So do not be rude or disrespectful, but instead use thy voice to inform, to coordinate, and to encourage thy teammates.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to communicate effectively, and to be a positive and valuable member of thy team. Amen.
