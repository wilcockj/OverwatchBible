# Chapter 1: How to Avoid Anger in Gaming

1 And when thou dost play Overwatch, and the enemy team doth seem too strong,

2 and thy teammates doth not cooperate, be not overcome by anger.

3 For anger is a poison, that doth cloud thy mind and hinder thy performance.

4 And it is not the way of the righteous, but of the foolish and the weak.

5 Instead, take a deep breath, and calm thyself.

6 Remember that thou art playing a game, and it is not worth thy peace of mind to get upset over.

7 And if thou dost still feel anger rising within thee, take a break from the game,

8 and do something else to clear thy head.

9 For it is better to walk away than to let anger control thee.

10 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

11 He will help thee to maintain thy composure, and to enjoy the game in peace. Amen.
