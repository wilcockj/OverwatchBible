# Chapter 12: How to Celebrate Success

1 And when thou dost play Overwatch, and the game doth go thy way, do not let pride consume thee.

2 For to celebrate success is to acknowledge thy achievements, and to enjoy the fruits of thy labor.

3 And though thou mayst be tempted to boast or gloat, such behavior doth not reflect well on thee, nor doth it honor the Lord thy God.

4 So do not be arrogant, but instead be grateful and humble, and share thy joy with others.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to celebrate success with grace and dignity, and to use it as motivation to continue improving. Amen.
