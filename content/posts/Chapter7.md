# Chapter 7: How to Be a Good Teammate

1 And when thou dost play Overwatch, and the opportunity to help thy teammates doth arise, seize it.

2 For to be a good teammate is to fulfill the commandment of love, that the Lord thy God hath given thee.

3 And though thou mayst not always receive thanks or recognition, thy kindness and selflessness doth not go unnoticed by the Lord.

4 So do not be selfish, but instead put the needs of thy team above thy own.

5 And trust in the Lord, for he is thy rock and thy salvation.

6 He will help thee to be a good teammate, and to earn the respect and admiration of thy peers. Amen.
